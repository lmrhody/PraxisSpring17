Description
-------------

Encouraging students think about the impact advancements in digital technology have on the future of scholarship from the moment they enter the Graduate Center, the Digital Praxis Seminar is a year-long sequence of two three-credit courses that familiarize students with a variety of digital tools and  methods through lectures offered by high-profile scholars and technologists, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students enrolled in the two-course sequence will complete their first year at the GC having been introduced to a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies in their academic research and teaching. In addition, they will have explored a particular area of digital scholarship and/or pedagogy of interest to them, produced a digital project in collaboration with fellow students, and established a digital portfolio that can be used to display their work. The two connected three-credit courses will be offered during the Fall and Spring semesters as MALS classes for master’s students and Interdisciplinary Studies courses for doctoral students.

During the Fall 2016 semester, students learned to recognize contemporary or long-standing challenges facing humanistic research and pedagogy and then placed those examples in conversation with readings in theory and technology. Considering opportunities and challenges digital technologies present to scholars engaged in humanistic inquiry, students identified humanities datasets, contextualized the dataset's potential contribution within their own academic discipline, and proposed future DH projects. In Spring 2017, we will refine and evaluate DH proposals, develop a reasonable workplan, design effective collaborations, develop new technical skills, and produce a project prototype. Early in the semester, students will split into project cohorts. Students will self-organize, actively work toward mutually agreed-upon deadlines, and adapt to the challenges and realities that collaborative digital projects present. Upon completion, students will be able to demonstrate hands-on experience in the planning, production, and dissemination of a digital humanities project.

The class will present their work at the GC End-of-the-Year Digital Showcase with 10-minute, multimodal talks. Students are strongly encouraged to consider their work as genuine contributions to a public dialogue on the use of digital tools in and around the academy. While projects are not required to extend beyond the end of the semester, they should propose a timeline and trajectory that extends beyond the course itself. The Spring term is inspired by the work of the Praxis Program at the University of Virginia and the One Week | One Tool projects at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. Praxis projects are made possible with support from the Graduate Center Provost’s Office and the GC Digital Fellows Program.

Learning Objectives
--------------------

Students will...
- plan and produce a digital humanities project that includes a revised proposal, data management plan, prototype, and scholarly outreach;
- develop scholarly collaboration skills (ie leadership, consensus building, joint evaluation, resource sharing) by working with a peer cohort to produce group project prototypes;
- describe individual scholarly contributions to the cohort's collective effort;
- justify key technical, scholarly, and interpersonal decisions especially as they relate to humanistic values through team-based lab journals, public blogging on our course site, and oral presentations;
- identify and aquire necessary new skills independently.

Requirements and Structure
----------------------------

**Weekly Class Sessions**

This is a praxis-based course, so most of our class sessions will be devoted to team meetings, project work, informal and formal presentations, and consultations with Graduate Center Digital Fellows. Weekly readings will be assign on an as-needed basis. Students are expected to be working independently and collaboratively every week on their projects and project plans.

**Progress Reports and Social Media Presence**

Each team will produce at least one public, process-oriented project report each week, to be posted on our shared course blog and *tagged with a project-specific tag.* Reports should catalogue project activities, discuss the progress that's been made, explore tricky problems, reach out to the general public with questions, and cultivate interest in the project.

Each team should also create a social media presence for their projects and use such accounts to share information and build an audience for the project.

**Individual Lab Journals**

Each student will keep an individual journal that should be used to catalogue weekly activities and progress, explore sticky questions, share personal reflections, and work through problems. Journals can be posted publicly to the course blog or kept privately. They should be shared with Prof. Rhody every week and are *due by midnight, Sunday.*

You must let Prof. Rhody know where you will be keeping your journal by midnight, February 8th, when your first post is due.


**Project Requirements**

- Projects should relate to the digital humanities as explored through the Fall semester.
- Project plans should address all aspects of the project life cycle, from development to deployment to testing to launch to sustainability. 
- Projects must be made publicly available and project code must be open source and accessible online.
- All code must be logically organized and clearly documented.
- A prototype of the project must be realized by the end of the semester.
- Projects will be launched publicly at the final class of the year.

**Project Report and Personal Reflection**

- A final project report (15-20 pages) must be submitted by each team at the end of the semester.
- Each student in the class will also submit a paper (3-5 pages) that details their contributions to the project and how the experience of working on it fits into the arc of their professional development and interests.

Grading
--------

- 75% -- team project grade
- 25% -- individual grade, based on lab journals, faculty consultations and your contributions to the team project.

Readings
--------------

To be determined based on project needs and in-class discussion.
